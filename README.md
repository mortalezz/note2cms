**Past-Browser Publishing Protocol (PBPP)**

*Write where you think. Publish where they look. Own everything in between.*

## What Is This

A CMS that is not a CMS. Four API endpoints that turn your notes app into a blogging tool.

You write in Apple Notes, Bear, Obsidian, vim — wherever you think. You push Markdown to an endpoint. Two parallel pipelines fire: one builds a beautiful static HTML page, the other updates a lightweight taxonomy. You get a permalink back. Share it with the world.

No admin panel. No browser-based editor. No login screen. No monthly fee. No vendor lock-in. The output is static HTML served from a CDN. The infrastructure is disposable. Your words are the only thing that persists.

## How It Works

```

       │
       ▼  POST /publish (Bearer token)
  ┌────────────────────────┐
  │  FastAPI (4 endpoints)  │
  │  ┌──────────┬─────────┐ │

  Static HTML    PostgreSQL/SQLite
  (GitHub Pages,    (post index)
   Cloudflare,
   any CDN)
       │
       ▼
  Reader gets pure HTML + CSS
  Zero JavaScript. Instant load.
```

## The API

| Method   | Endpoint               | Description                    |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `POST`   | `/publish`             | Push Markdown, get a permalink |
| `GET`    | `/posts/{slug}/source` | Get original Markdown back     |
| `DELETE` | `/posts/{slug}`        | Remove a post                  |
| `GET`    | `/posts`               | List all posts                 |

That's the whole CMS.

## Theming

A theme is a function. It receives props, it returns HTML. The default ships as Jinja2 templates (zero dependencies) or React JSX components (for developers who want component composition).

Want to change your blog's entire visual identity? Replace two template files. A bootcamp grad can build a production theme in an afternoon.

## Deployment

note2cms runs for free. The entire stack:

| Component       | Free Tier                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| **API Runtime** | [Leapcell](https://leapcell.io)    |
| **Database**    | Leapcell PostgreSQL                |
| **Static Host** | GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages    |
| **SSL**         | Automatic via GitHub Pages         |
| **CDN**         | Automatic via GitHub Pages         |

**Total cost: a domain name. Twelve dollars a year.**

See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for the complete step-by-step deployment guide.

## Publishing

From the command line:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api.leapcell.dev/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"markdown": "---\ntitle: Hello World\ntags: [first]\n---\n\nMy first post."}'
```

From a Markdown file:

```bash
jq -Rs '{markdown: .}' post.md | curl -X POST \
  https://your-api.leapcell.dev/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @-
```

From iOS: a Shortcut that reads your note, wraps it in JSON, POSTs to the endpoint, copies the permalink.

From Android: a Share Intent to any HTTP client app.

## Editing

Want to edit a post? Get your original Markdown back:

```bash
curl https://your-api.leapcell.dev/posts/hello-world/source \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" > post.md
```

Edit it in your notes app. Push it again. Same slug, updated content, rebuilt HTML.

## Architecture Principles

- **O(1) builds.** Publish one post, build one post. Your archive of 500 posts is untouched.
- **Markdown is the system of record.** Database and HTML are derived. Delete them, rebuild from source.
- **Build pipeline is disposable.** Workers wake up, transform, vanish. No residual state.
- **A theme is a function.** Data in, markup out. React, Jinja2, Svelte — the pipeline does not care.
- **Infrastructure is replaceable.** Move to any server, any host, any database. Only the domain matters.

## Self-Hosting

For those who prefer their own server over free tiers:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mortalezz/note2cms.git
cd note2cms
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"  # your API token

# Set environment variables
export API_TOKEN=your-generated-token
export SITE_TITLE="My Blog"
export SITE_URL=http://localhost:8000

uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

SQLite taxonomy, local filesystem, no external dependencies. rsync it, git it, tar it. The infrastructure is replaceable. Your words are not.
